# Change Log

All notable changes to the "vscode-nuget-gallery" extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.1]

### Added

- Support for pinned package versions using NuGet's exact version notation `[x.x.x]`
  - Packages with exact version constraints (e.g., `Version="[11.1.0]"`) are now recognized as "pinned"
  - Pinned versions skip inline update decorations in the editor
  - Update icon is hidden for pinned packages in the project list
  - In the installed packages tab, update icon shows only if at least one project allows updates (is not pinned)
  - Version ranges like `[1.0,2.0]`, `(1.0,)`, `[1.0,)` are NOT considered pinned and will show updates normally
- Configuration setting `NugetGallery.prerelease` to control whether prerelease versions are included when checking for package updates

### Fixed

- Fixed password script executing multiple times when fetching packages from sources with password script authentication. The script now executes only once and concurrent requests share the result.
- Fixed prerelease checkbox state not being persisted across sessions
- Fixed inline package version decorator always fetching prerelease versions regardless of the prerelease checkbox setting
- Fixed prerelease setting synchronization between UI and configuration
- Fixed package dependencies not loading when "All" sources is selected
- Fixed package dependencies not parsing correctly for NuGet feeds that embed dependency data directly in the catalog entry

## [2.0.0]

### Added

- Decorator for file editor that shows which packages are available to update (configurable via `NugetGallery.enablePackageVersionInlineInfo`)
- 'All' option in source dropdown to search and fetch packages from all configured sources simultaneously
- Support for Central Package Management (CPM)
  - Automatically detects and resolves package versions from `Directory.Packages.props`
  - Respects individual project opt-out via `<ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>false</ManagePackageVersionsCentrally>`
  - Prevents `--no-restore` bug that causes versions to be added to project files when CPM is enabled
  - Automatically refreshes all projects when updating packages in CPM-enabled solutions
- Package update functionality (remove and re-add with new version)
- NuGet.config authentication support
  - Automatic detection and parsing of NuGet.config files from workspace, user, and machine locations
  - Support for encrypted passwords in NuGet.config via custom password decryption scripts
  - Password script support for PowerShell (.ps1), batch (.bat/.cmd), and executable files
  - Cached credentials to minimize script executions (5-minute TTL)
  - Source-level password script configuration through VS Code settings
- Status bar loading indicator (configurable via `NugetGallery.statusBarLoadingIndicator`)
- Package update status shown in status bar
- Configurable logging level (configurable via `NugetGallery.logLevel`)
- Visual indication of failed package fetches in the package list
- Display "Multiple" text for packages with mixed versions across projects

- Replaced credential provider authentication with NuGet.config-based authentication
